# High Frequency Radar Task Team

High Frequency Radar (HFR) is a unique technology mapping ocean surface currents and wave fields (along with other variables) over wide areas with high
spatial and temporal resolution. HF Radar is cost-effective, requiring only small manpower and technical costs. 

Users of HF Radar technology include meteorology services, search and rescue agencies, governments and regional and local authorities, as well as private
companies working in assessment of coastal water quality, renewable energy, or other environmental services.

The [EuroGOOS HF Radar Task Team](https://eurogoos.eu/high-frequency-radar-task-team/) helps coordinate the European activities around the development and
use of this coastal technology. The Task Team is providing a European HF Radar operational network delivering data and products for science, environmental
management, and operational needs. As all EuroGOOS operational task teams, the HF Radar Task Team plays an important role in identifying research gaps, 
delivering common standards and promoting synergy, towards an integrated European Ocean Observing System ([EOOS](http://eurogoos.eu/eoos/)).

The EuroGOOS HF Radar Task Team contributes to improving administrative procedures, promotes scientific synergies and complementarity with other technologies
as well as modeling products. The Task Teamâ€™s broad network allows sharing success stories and discuss common challenges, to allow a stronger joint progress.

Specifically, the HF Radar Task Team aims to:

- Define data standards and products;
- Define and share the quality assurance and quality control standards;
- Promote research, technology and innovation development; 
- Enhance interface between the technology providers and implementers. 

The EuroGOOS HFR Task Team is coordinating the European High Frequency Radar Node ([EU HFR Node](https://www.hfrnode.eu/)) as the focal point and operational
asset in Europe for HFR data management and dissemination, also promoting networking between EU infrastructures and the Global HFR network.
